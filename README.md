# Boreas
Boreas is a full fiberglass 90cm long rocket, expected to reach up to 2km and fly over Mach 1 (Mach 1.2 actually), in an I205W high power motor, utilizing dual development and other high-power rocketry techniques. If you want to make it yourself, I recommend you first get your L1 with another rocket; handling fiberglass is very dangerous and difficult, so do it at your own risk!! Also, this rocket doesn't have any railguides, so you'll need to build a 40mm launch tower or just go to a club and use the one they have. Be really careful handling motors and always follow NAR/TRIPOLI rules!!!
