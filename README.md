### Desing overview

### **1- Aerodynamic stability**

- OpenRocket design (sub-sonic)

- RASAero design (supersonic)
Firstly, in OpenRocket, I designed the structure of the airframe, where I assigned the materials, motor, airframe size, and fin size. I added a boat tail to reduce drag, dual development (The nosecone has the main parachute, which gets opened 150 m above ground level by a flight computer, and the booster section has the drogue; the drogue gets deployed during apogee), and I included "through-the-wall" fins to distribute the thrust of the motor around the whole airframe.
Then, in RASAero, I checked the stability at supersonic speeds and some other drag stuff.

### **2- Motor mount - fin can designing**

This is the design of my fin can-motor mount. I'll use a fiberglass motor mount tube, centering rings, and an airframe. Still, as said before, I'm using plywood for my fins, with 3 holes that get into the airframe to distribute loads. Then I'll laminate 2 layers of 6oz fiberglass over it, finding a good, cheap-quality epoxy for "laminating" fiberglass (what im doing with the nosecone and fins) was very hard. Firstly, I wanted to buy some epoxy from West Systems, but a few liters of that epoxy were like 100$!! So I did some more research and I found the total boat, they have some good epoxy, but it was still very expensive, but then I found out that I could use table top epoxy for the job, and this one was just 40$!! So I went with this one, same for the adhesive, I wanted to use JB weld, but I found "Aeropoxy Structural Adhesive", which is just 40$for  the 2 liters, so I also went for this as my adhesive

The boat tail is going to be made out of PETG-CF, and it's going to get screwed in with 4, 4M screws. It also works as a motor reteiner; this part is essential to hold the motor during the parachute ejection.

### **3- Avbay design - avionics**

My avbay is an inside tube that holds both of my flight computers, it has 2, 0.9 grams pyros on the top, one is going to be connected to my; it connects the nosecone with the booster section. It also holds my avionics, my main is High Tel (still in progress), and my secondary is an Eggtimer Quark (Commercial for safety). This will all work with a 1, 7V Lipo and a 1, 3,3v Lipo. Now, in the structure, the main tube is a 38-36mm fiberglass tube. I have 2 fiberglass bulkheads to protect the top and bottom of the avbay; this also holds 2 eye-bolts, which get tied into the shock cord. The ring that is in the middle is called "switch band", this piece is in charge of stopping the avbay from sliding further into the airframe-nosecone. I have 2 M4 threaded rods, which are in charge of pressing everything together and holding my avionics in place.

### **4- Nosecone - Recovery**

This is my nosecone; it's made out of fiberglass. For making this nosecone, I'm going to use this mold:

It has the size of the inside of the nosecone. I'm going to lay up fiberglass sleeves to make the outside of the nosecone, like the picture above, then I'm gonna hammer it out:

As I can't make the tip from fiberglass because of the size, I'm going to make it out of aluminum with JLC. This gets secured with an eye bolt, which also provides an M4 attachment point for the shock cord.

For recovery, I'm going to use 2 "parachutes", a drogue (9" thin mill parachute) in the booster section (This one gets deployed at apogee), and as a main parachute, a top-flight 24" thin mill parachute, this one is located on the nosecone, it gets deployed 100m agl, for the shock cord im using kelvar, as this has some steel like strength, for my case, the best option is the 1500lb one (kinda over-kill, but i want more than less).
